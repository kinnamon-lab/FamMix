Description: This package implements mixed models for family-based genetic
    studies. While such models can be fit with other existing software, this
    package tries to provide a unified solution in the R environment. It also
    leverages modern automatic differentiation techniques to fit models
    quickly and allow a wider variety of likelihood based inferential
    procedures.
