Description: This package implements regression models for family-based genetic
    studies, including mixed models. While such models can be fit with other
    existing software, this package tries to provide a unified solution in the
    R environment. It also leverages modern automatic differentiation techniques
    to fit model quickly and allow a wider variety of likelihood based
    inferential procedures.
