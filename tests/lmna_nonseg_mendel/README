Mendel Files for Test Cases
---------------------------

This directory contains inputs and outputs for univariate linear mixed models
fit using Mendel 16.0. The input data were obtained from commit 469141d of
https://github.com/kinnamon-lab/lmna_nonseg, and a correction to fix switched
parental IDs identical to the one in data-raw/lmna_nonseg.R was made to
lmna_nonseg.ped.

In comparing snapshot test results for this package to these results, the
following should be noted:
1) Point estimates should be nearly identical for all parameters (after
   appropriate transformation for sigma).
2) Standard errors should be nearly identical except for heritability, for which
   there may be a bug in Mendel. The estimated standard errors for sigma_a and
   sigma_e in Mendel can be reproduced by transforming the observed information
   matrix (inverse covariance matrix) from FamModel in the manner described by
   Boos and Stefanski (2013), Essential Statistical Inference, section 2.5.3 and
   inverting. In the other direction, the FamModel standard errors for h2_a and
   sigma can be reproduced from the Mendel information matrix (inverse
   covariance matrix) using the same approach.
3) The Mendel loglikehood appears to omit the factor -(N/2) ln (2*pi), where
   N is the number of non-probands. This factor is included in TMB's
   multivariate normal density macro that is used in FamModel. Loglikelihoods
   in Mendel and FamModel should differ by exactly this factor, and variance
   component likelihood ratio chi-squared statistics calculated from the
   difference in Mendel loglikelihoods should match FamModel output.
4) The Mendel person outlier quadratic form appears to be the square of
   r_star_hat, and the pedigree outlier statistic appears to be c_star_hat based
   on discussion in the following references:
